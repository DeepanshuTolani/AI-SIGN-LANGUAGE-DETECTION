# 🤟 Sign-language Recognition System

This project integrates **sign language recognition** to enhance accessibility for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. By using **hand gesture recognition** and **machine learning models**, the system interprets signs in real time and converts them into **readable or audible outputs**, effectively bridging the communication gap.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition  
- Conversion of signs to text and speech  
- User-friendly interface  
- Enhances accessibility and communication for the deaf and mute community  
- Easily extendable with custom gestures and models

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) libraries  
- Streamlit / Tkinter (optional GUI)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Capture hand gestures via webcam  
2. Process frames using computer vision techniques  
3. Predict sign language using a trained ML model  
4. Display or vocalize the interpreted output
